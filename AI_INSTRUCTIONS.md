waw-angular is a waw module that provides a convention-based Angular scaffolding CLI by exposing generator commands through `server/angular/cli.js` and writing template-based files into an Angular project under `src/app/`. It supports generators for alerts (`waw alert`), components (`waw component` / `waw c`), form components (`waw formcomponent` / `waw fc`, including updating or creating `src/app/app.formcomponents.ts` to register the new component), icons (`waw icon` / `waw i`), interfaces (`waw interface`), loaders (`waw loader` / `waw l`), modals (`waw modal` / `waw m`), feature modules (`waw module` plus aliases `waw add` and `waw a`), pages (`waw page` / `waw p` with selectable page templates and route injection into `src/app/app.routes.ts` at a marker comment), pipes (`waw pipe`), selectors (`waw selector`), and services (`waw service` / `waw s`); each generator derives the target name from CLI args or interactive prompts using `waw.terminal()`, computes a target folder under `waw.projectPath/src/app/<type>s/<name>`, and then copies and token-replaces template files using filesystem helpers such as `waw.ensureDir()` and `waw.readWrite()`, after which the generator prints a success message and exits the process.
